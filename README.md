Vaultwarden is a powerful, open-source, and password management tool.
An alternative server implementation of the Bitwarden Client API, written in Rust and compatible with [official Bitwarden clients](https://bitwarden.com/download/), perfect for self-hosted deployment where running the official resource-heavy service might not be ideal.

My small fork example generates a configuration files for a reverse proxy balancing nginx which also regulates service availability at the level of service access rules. You can distribute external access to the service or restrict access. Provide access only to off-network users from VPN traffic or external IP addresses specified by you. I also made some minor changes to the way logs are maintained and created.

All you need to do to install Vaultwarden:
- My installed nginx-le image
- Specify your network parameters in docker manifest
- Change the env_example file to .env and set the variable values ​​in the .env file.
- Have free resources on the host/hosts
- Deploy docker compose manifest
- Move configuration files from the mounted volume vaultwarden_nginx_conf to the volume with the nginx configuration files of the nginx container:
  service* file to conf.d-le directory
  stream* file to stream.d-le directory
- Reboot Nginx container for apply configs
- Follow the instructions from the official Nexus source for personalized service settings
